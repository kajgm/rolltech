# Rolltech - Chairable

Roll Technology presents Chairable, a revolutionary product designed to explore the immature field of spherical wheel technology.

- Chairable utilizes a spherical wheel design for tight maneuvering and a space-efficient footprint
- Leverages an adjustable clamping mechanisim to enable modular attachment to a variety of office chairs
- A large 7000mAh lithium polymer battery and a powerful 2200W motor provide the ability to move a 125kg load at a 2.5m/s pace
- Uses a carefully crafted mechanical design implemented with machined steel and custom 3D printed elements
- A safe and robust experience is achieved through a fully enclosed electrical circuit with 14+ motor control, logic, and safety elements
- Operated remotely using a tailored PCB design, a custom controller casing, and a specifically crafted low-power circuit.
